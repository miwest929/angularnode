# angularnode
A gem that will automatically generate a bare-bones AngularJS, NodeJS project for you.

I created this gem out of a necessity. For any new experiments, I found myself constantly `cp -r` a previous Node project 
so I can have a working baseline. After which a series of manual steps were required to tailor the new project to the new experiment.  
Thus, I created a gem that will do all that work for me.
